        About Me
    </div>

    <div class="page-text">What does it take to get to know someone? I could tell you how I love to dive deep into research on software engineering and computer science problems, topics, and projects. I love it so much, in fact, that I made a career out of doing just that by making an in-depth and entertaining YouTube video about it afterwards. <br>
        Or maybe I could lay out my history to prove how much I love this stuff. Like how I've been riveted by math for as long as I can remember, or how I've been actively coding since 2013 and graduated with a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Computer Science in 2018. <br>
        Is that it? What about how I put those learnings into practice? I've had various internships throughout my college career, and upon graduating, worked professionally as a full-stack software engineer building enterprise applications until late-2019. And now we're back to the whole "diving deep into research" and "making a YouTube video" part of my journey. So what's that all about? <br><br>
        
        Well, it's my humble attempt at building my version of the digital world one step at a time by creating software engineering and computer science content to help those coming behind me. And now that I do YouTube full-time, I'm able to focus on building projects and researching my many areas of interest in this space, all while working with great companies including JetBrains, NVIDIA, Intel, Coursera, Notion, LG, Bright Data</div>
